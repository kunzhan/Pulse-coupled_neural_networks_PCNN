# Pulse-coupled neural networks
Pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNN) have an inherent ability to process the signals associated with the digital visual images because it is inspired from the neuronal activity in the primary visual area, V1, of the neocortex.  Many examples of processing mechanisms are provided to make it clear and concise.
